# Portfolio 

 My portfolio website contains a description about me, my previous projects, and the tools and technologies that I know for software development. I created this portfolio website using React JavaScript and styled it with CSS. My plans for this website is to demonstrate my skills as a Software Engineer to employers to obtain jobs.
